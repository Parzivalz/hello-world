# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository -- long overdue!

I honestly probably should've put all of my projects on here earlier. I developed a lot of cool projects over the past couple years and deleted them when migrating to different systems and because I just didn't feel the need to do anything more with them, but now I'm going to start putting up all of my work on GitHub; I realized that it is important to showcase my talents and my hard work to the world.
